      <p>
        Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>Mitchell Brown</strong>, a software developer with a
        background in
        <strong> Computer Science and Philosophy (B.Sc.)</strong>. I specialize
        in building full-stack applications using <strong>React</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>Flask</strong>, and
        <strong> Docker</strong>, and Iâ€™m passionate about applying{" "}
        <strong>AI and automation</strong>
        to solve real-world problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iâ€™ve worked on projects ranging from <em>portfolio websites</em> to
        <em> AI-powered business tools</em>, and Iâ€™ve also consulted with
        companies on emerging technologies. My strengths include quickly
        learning new frameworks, designing clean user experiences, and writing
        maintainable, scalable code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy{" "}
        <em>music production, creative writing, and watching movies</em>. Iâ€™m
        actively looking for opportunities where I can contribute to impactful
        software projects and grow alongside experienced developers.
      </p>
